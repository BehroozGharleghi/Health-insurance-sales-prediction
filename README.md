# Project Title: Health Insurance Sales Prediction
### The Story
This is about an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers, now the company needs help in building a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company again.

Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.

Now, in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, I will use the below information: demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), and Policy (Premium, sourcing channel).

Therefore we are interested to predict the response of the customer to take up the insurance (Probability of response 'yes' or '1'). The evaluation metric for this project is ROC_AUC score.
